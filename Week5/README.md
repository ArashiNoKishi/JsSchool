# Week 5 Briefing

In this week, the examination results of all the challenges to date were given, the evaluations were rough but helpful. It made the Challenge5 code refactoring a task for this week. From making the visual appearance more accurate to the proposed design to make the code easier to understand and more scalable were the goals for this refactor. unfortunately, this refactoring was too much time consuming leaving a lot less time to focus on this week challenge.

Aside from the refactoring that was due this week, the week's material was focused on back-end information so that working with APIs and node.js route handling (with express) were easier, with the use of a nosql database in MongoDB and a couple other libraries of node, this week's challenge was about making a simple back-end app to go along with the previous week challenge.

notes on challenge 6:
first run with node the "populatedb.js" to use the app.
then run the app.js, login is required and either: "user", "user123" and "jobsity", "jobsity123" are valid pairs.
