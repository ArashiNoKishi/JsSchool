# Week 6 Briefing

Finaly the JsSchool started with the target environment with React information.
Again with a bit of dense information, but nothing compared to Week 1, with all the basics to work with React and its differences to actual real frameworks like Angular.
The fact that the virtual DOM used by React that makes working with it a lot simpler as it is not needed anymore to manipulate the DOM directly with the use of states and props to make quick updates and, of course, creating Components that could be reused was the challenge of owrking with React.7

Challenge5 code refactoring was due to this week too, but it must be refactored to React Components as Challenge7 with some added tasks including connecting to Challenge6's API to make a close to full stack app on both the front and back end.
