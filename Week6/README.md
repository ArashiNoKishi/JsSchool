# Week 6 Briefing

Finaly the JsSchool started with the target environment with React information.
Again with a bit of dense information, but nothing compared to Week 1, with all the basics to work with React and its differences to actual real frameworks like Angular.
The fact that the virtual DOM used by React that makes working with it a lot simpler as it is not needed anymore to manipulate the DOM directly with the use of states and props to make quick updates and, of course, creating Components that could be reused was the challenge of owrking with React.7

Challenge5 code refactoring was due to this week too, but it must be refactored to React Components as Challenge7 with some added tasks including connecting to Challenge6's API to make a close to full stack app on both the front and back end.


# Week 7 Briefing

In React intermediate had topics that had to be read in week 6's challenge so for this week there were not many topics to be improved on, just a bit of specific things like more in depth knowledge about the lifecycle of the components that were usefull to prevent memory overload in my react app.
Then the Security basics in jwt was a topic of this week, however, it was already being worked on the app in development so it was also just more in depth information about it.

Challenge7 code refactor had many of this week's in depth topics about jwt and react that were added even before the actual issues were announced.

# Week 8 Briefing

Week 8 was mostly about heavy refactoring, as feedback was due and it was required to add redux to the app. But it started with ways of styling components right on their classfiles, it was the easy but time consuming task for the challenge. Then there was Redux and it started with a lot of concepts about flux patters and how Redux was made based off of it, it's concepts were understandable, but the hard part was making it work as it is far from easy to implement, however, help from senior workmates made that a lot easier to understand and implement.
