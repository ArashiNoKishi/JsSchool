# Week 3 Briefing

In this week in the JsSchool we started working on Javascript, we had a couple of excercises to practice Javascript calls and its interaction with the html with DOM manipulation.

At first, the information was so much basic that made the information from the frist week easier to understand, and the excercises helped with that making me try different posibilities to make possible the results.

The first two excercises were about arrays and ways to rearrange them, they were on the easy part of javascript, nothing I have not done before. The other two however, I had to think about ways to manage Javascript innate objects, like the Date and localstorage.

At last, the challenge was about creating elements in html and add listeners with Javascript and only Javascript, no other addons or libraries. However the way of encouragin this event adding challenge was by creating a piano with working key bindings and chords. Doing this challenge was so much fun, just trying different things to make the piano work like I wanted to and the way a wanted to.
