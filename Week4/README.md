# Week 4 Briefing

In this week in Jobsity's JsSchool the information was first about setting up an IDE to work with Javascript and some plugins and extensions to make coding with it a bit easier, things like node.js, VS code and the first mentions of React were here.

Second, it was all about ES6, by far the heaviest and densest information of this week, and nearly as dense as first week's information but now that it was required to use some of those informations on the challenge, it was a lot better due to the fact tha applying the knowledge is by far the best way to learn something.

At last, we had transpilers for us to see how to run ES6 code in older browsers, it was just a few videos of information about them on how to use and easy ways to get the best of them. Also at last were HTTP requests with Javascript and a first real interaction with promises.

The challenge was not that difficult, but given the fact that it was a lot of requirements, time constrains were up here that also a deadline extension was given.

To conclude, this week is so far the most productive in terms of lines of code per day and also with the most learnt things.

Note: to run the challenge, a localserver is needed to get the local json file to load up via http.
